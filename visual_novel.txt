Hey, you have a bit of jam on your cheek;
Where?;

No, the other cheek;
 I don't... Can you please clean it for me...
Nyan-Senpai? @; 
Bu-bu-t;
Ehhh...!;
           That would be a indirect
              ki ..  ki  kiss; 
Whoa, HEY! Did you hear that?!;
JUMP!;
18- ROCKS FALL DOWN;
 *Cough, Cough*

 Don't just stand there, Piko! Grab your 
hammer and help me bash these rocks!; 
Yay! It's the final day of class! Let's go!;
Piko, aren't you anxious about the final exam?;
 Nah, today I'm gonna beat everyone 
who makes fun of me! You'll see.; 
 Wow, you look so confident with that
plastic hammer of yours... wait...; 
Didn't you build it yourself?;
 I can't wait to see the looks on their faces! 
I'm gonna be the best Blacksmith, heh heh!; 
Piko, are you even listening to what I'm saying?;
I'm sorry, did you say anything?;
Eeh?;
Hurry, we're gonna be late!;

AHA;
HEHE;
HAHAHA;
...;
SILENCE!!;
Ahem, today is
the day of your
final exam!;

opportunity to 
smith yourself a 
new future!;
Now go! Good luck, 
and make me proud!;
Also...;
Piko, Nyan,
I'll need you to
stay after class. 
I have to talk 
to you two.;
50- SMALL TEACHER TALK ;
All right. Nyan, you got the best grades again.;
Good job, looks like you don't even need to 
take the test.;
Hey, that's not fair! I don't want to do the 
test either!;
Piko, you're barely above a passing grade. 
You should be thankful that I didn't round 
down the last 0.01 point, otherwise you'd flunk out!;
Also, since both of you managed to show up 
late, let me explain how it works once more:;
After the test battle, each of you will travel 
to do internship work, or fight each other 
for the final prize.;
That sounds awesome! What is the final prize?;
Beats me. Not even I know what'll happen 
when you find the Master of Blacksmiths and 
are blessed by the holy red power;
When my test came, I had to stay behind to 
follow this career. I wonder how many 
of you will do the same?;
Anyway, run along now. The test is to be taken 
at the library;
61-FIGHT WITH THE TUTORIAL BOSS;
WOAH! Your hammer glows so much!
 Who are you?;
 Let's see... You are Piko, right? 
  Please grab your hammer, 
   it's time to start the test.; 
 Huh? What do you mean? 
I've got my hammer right here!; 
 Hah, you are Piko using a Piko Piko hammer,
that's funny!; 
 Ahem, sorry for my behavior, but...
I do need you to grab an actual hammer.; 
 ...               
            Uhh...???; 
 She is really gonna use and Plastic hammer?
Oh my...; 
 Why are you using a Piko Piko, such a 
childish toy, as a blacksmith weapon?; 
Have you no honor? Have you no shame?;
 Oh well... Don't say I didn't warn you. 
  Show me your skill, and don't 
     come crying to me when I defeat you!; 
72- AT THE FIGHT THE LIGHTS TURN OFF;
Gah, who turned off the lights?!;
°
             SOO DARK!; 
It's ok, I got this!;
Agh, my eyes! Point that some other way, 
will you?;
 C'mon, let's keep fighting! 
  It's gonna be way more exciting 
    with the lights out!; 
 Ugh, I have no time for this. 
  Piko, you stay here. 
    I'm gonna check on the teachers.; 
 Hey, I have a great idea! 
I'm gonna check the generator room!; 
 What's the deal with that girl?! 
  Her hammer didn't take any damage! 
         Could it be...?; 
And... what is this dokidoki@feeling in my chest...?;
What happened here? Where's the school?;
I just hope everyone is okay... ;
But this way I'll never...;
 Don't worry Piko, these earthquakes 
happen all the time; 
 Besides, your schoolmates are tough. 
I'm sure they're fine.; 
But... I'll never graduate like this! ;
What the... THAT'S what you're worried about?!;

94-AFTER TANK FIGHT;
YAY! I WIN!!;
 Wait a minute, isn't she a senior?
Does that mean... I’ve passed the test?
I can graduate now that I beat her?; 
Heh... Hey Piko what is that on the ground?;
...
       [ Third grade, transfer student ]     ; 
 Wha... Did I just beat up some little kid?

She really slipped...;
134- WATER GIRL;
What a weird looking dolphin!
It's okay little buddy, we can still be friends!;
How come you can talk underwater? 
And why can I do it too?;
A talking dolphin! @ How adorable! 
Come here, my hairy friend!  @@;
Um... You've got the wrong of it, miss.
I'm not a dolphin, you see...;
Wha... So you must be one of those 
dirty surface dwellers! ;
Dumping your trash hither and tither, 
the whole ocean as your garbage bin!;
WHY WON'T YOU LEAVE THE SEA ALONE?!;

Oww, my head...;
Ehhhn?...;
HI!!;
Gah! What are you!?;
Oh my, is that any way 
to talk to your savior?;
...What?;
Poor thing, you must have 
hit your head or something!;
You're acting all cuckoo and your
eyes keep darting about like crazy!;
Are you calling me crazy?;
I'll have you know that 
the blow to my head only 
made the air smell faintly
of strawberries!;
Otherwise, I'm perfectly fine!;
Perfectly loco,
more like!;
Sigh... So it was you 
who saved me?;
YES!! DOCTOR NEKO
always helps her patients! 
She even gives them free hats!;
Thanks then...;
Uh, thanks...? 
Wait, that's not a hat...;
A PANTSU?;
♥ My favorite strawberry one;
Here, you got so caught up with 
all the crippling brain damage that 
you forgot your hammer!;
186- NEKO THROW THE HAMMER;
Ouch!;
188- PIKO  FOUNDS THE TEACHER HAUSE;
Are you crazy, Cuckoo? 
What are you doing in the teacher's house?;
I'm sure Teacher-Sensei won't mind!;
 Geez, did those blows to her head 
give her a concussion or something?
Everybody knows you can't work in
the outside world if you live underground!; 
...Why are you looking at me like that?;
Poor thing, probably doesn't even have 
any friends.;
There, we're friends now!;
  EHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh??;
Aw, she's so happy she's in shock!;
Let me wake Sensei up, she'll
 explain everything!;
She's fast asleep, Cuckoo. I don't think
you'll be able to get her up... But I have an idea!;
Let's make a deal: you bring me some ingredients 
and I'll whip up a fresh batch of cookies. 
That's sure to wake 'er up!;
...If you say so!;
And my name's PIKO!;
 She already left the room...;
-203- PIKO TALKS TO THE OLEGUINHA THEN THE TRASH ROBOT APEARS;

EHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh??;
There you are! 
I missed you so much!;
Me... too... ugh, can't... breathe...;
KEEPS HUGGING;
I was so scared!

Oof...;
I think we managed to escape...;
Yeah, I can see the exit;
Dude, I still can't believe you found me!;
And I know where Teacher-sensei is,
maybe she can help us get to the surface!;
Hm... I wonder if I can build a new robot
with some of this trash, and then...;
No! No more robots, please. 
That's the second killer robot I've 
had to face in recent memory!;
Second? You mean there's another one?;
244- PIKO GO TO THE FIRE BOSS TO GET A STOVE FOR THE COKIES;
Hello, Miss Glowing Hair. What brings you to my 
humble fire pits?; 
What's that smell? Is something burning?;
That would be my Lava Hammer! 
Smells good, right?;
Eww... How does she even hold that thing 
without burning herself?; 
 Uh, I'm looking for a Mini Fire Stove... 
Have you seen anything like that around here?; 
What, like this one?;
Yeah! Can I borrow it? Please let me borrow it!;
Hmm... Maybe if you show me your FIRE
I'll let you borrow the stove.; 
...My what?;
 You know, your strength! Your burning will 
   that lets you conquer any challenge!
     I need to see it for myself 
       if you want me to be of any help.; 
 I dunno, I think I'm pretty strong!
  I defeated a bunch of enemies already,
    doesn't that count for something?; 
 Strength does not come from winning.
  Your struggles develop your strengths.
    When you go through hardships and 
      decide not to surrender!; 
°
             THAT IS STRENGTH; 
°
         PIKO FEELS DETERMINATION; 
 Let me show you how real this struggle gets!
We'll call it a... heh...; 
       The Ultimate Trial by Fire   of sorts! 
         Get ready, here I come!; 
228;
262-YOU BRING THE INGREDIENTS TO THE NEKO GIRL;
Hey there, bestie!;
Uh, hi...?;
I went and got everything you asked for, 
can you make the cookies now?;
Sugar... Check!;
Flour... Check!;
Totally not suspicious at all ingredient... Check!;
This stove is a bit too hot. Bin it, 
we're gonna need a new one.;
Aw, c'mon! That was hard to find!;
Wow, you suck at cooking! 
Don't be like that, let's go. I'll even let you 
pick the recipe!;
1. Mix flour, eggs and bake at 300ºF for 30 minutes;
2. Bung it all in and turn on the heat!;
274- TEACHER INSIDE HOME TALKING;
              
              Munching noises  ; 
Thanks for the cookies, how did you cook this?;
I have the fire reactor from Yutaka in the lava core!;
Piko, why do you insist on using that weird
 plastic hammer? It's a toy! For kids!;
And why do you insist on being so 
MEAN all the time?! Hmph!;
Sigh... So, did Yutaka give you the core?;
Oh, she lent it to me after I beat her up!;
 What? With that plastic thing you 
call a hammer? Really?
You're full of surprises, Piko. 
We'll make a blacksmith out of you yet!; 
Heheh!;
Here, I'll give you this card. 
Just present it at the department 
and you can be in the final competition!;
Now come closer and let me show you 
my new super ultra C.O.O.K.I.E. TECH (TM)!;
286-TEACHER EXPLAIN THE COOKIE THING;
DID YOU EVER STOP 
TO THINK ABOUT THE;
FUTURE?! ;
WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY
I CAN TELEPORT PEOPLE 
TO WHEREVER THEY WISH!;
BUT EVEN THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY...;
BEHOLD!;
THE;
NEON;
FUSION!!;
Ahem. Got a little 
carried away there;
 Sorry, I won't be able 
to teleport us to 
the department;
There's weird energies 
blocking our way;
You can take my special 
card though! 
I'll update your 
CookieMap for you;
 299-ICE VN ;
Ah yes, you came. 
I've been waiting for you... Hm...;
...Piko?;
Yes, Piko. I already knew your name. Ommmm...;
...What are you doing in the ice mountains? 
Aren't you supposed to be in the fire pits?;
That is not so. My family and powers 
might be those of fire, but...;
MY HERITAGE DOESN'T DEFINE WHO I AM!;
BEHOLD! I HAVE BECOME AN ICEKINI, THE ICE SAGE!;
Right. Congratulations expressing your 
personal agency and all that, but you have 
something that doesn't belong to you;
Give back the Ice Reactor you stole!;
You will never understand my plight! Living 
in a hot environment with a family of flames,
hating hot food...;
...I JUST WANTED TO EAT ICE CREAM!;
311- DEPARTAMENT ;
Yay! The queue is finally over,
time to get my certificate!;
Good afternoon, Miss.
Let me just check your pass...;
...;
I need you to sign here... 
There... 
Here again...;
Just one final check, and...;
...;
...You are UNDER ARREST for ASSAULTING 
a third grade transfer student!;
Ehh? But she had a huuuge tank!;
Says here it was a toy tank! 
You had no reason to 
attack her as you did!;
But... But...;
GUARDS!! TAKE HER!!;
323-NEKO NINJA;
What the...? Is that some sort of ninja?;
Ta-dah! Your best and only friend, 
which is kinda sad when you think about it, 
comes to your rescue!;
Well don't just stand there, arrest those two!;
OWO-BJECTION!!;
EH???;
EH???;
Piko didn't  assault  anyone! 
She was just playing, and 
I have PROOF!;
How could she assault anyone 
without a weapon? ;
Look closely at her hammer, 
it is merely a toy! ;
Why, I doubt you could hurt a fly 
with the sorry thing!;
...Fine, whatever. There was no assault, the 
hammer is just a toy and she can 
have the key to the test;
I'm only doing this to get rid of you two, 
you're starting to hold up the queue! 
Now go away, I have work to do!;
336- TANK COLISEUM;
Yo! Whatsyername-chan!;
I don't know how to pronounce your name... 
Heh, sorry!;
Palim, palim!;
You sound angry... Is it because of the tank? 
Sorry about that, too...;
You defeat me last time, but we have many 
tanks in Fatherland! 
Many, many box of noodles for every hungry child!;
Jetzt mal Butter bei die Fische!;
Now I defeat you with a weapon of your own 
fatherland: the Hummer!!;
Gosh, another Hammer duel? 
But I don't wanna fight,
I wanna go home and play the new Boku game!;
Wir sind ja nich aus Zucker!
Achtung!; 
346- BIG HAMMER COLISEUM;
 Well well well, if it isn't Little sits on the 2 chair
   Snoozes-Every-Day-At-School   
Piko herself!; 
...Who are you even?;
 I've been looking all over for you! 
I'm surprised you made it this far.; 
Eh?... Wait, are you a stalker?;
Wait, no! It's just that... I'm just like you, you see.;
You're creeping me out, dude.;
 You believe your plastic hammer can be the best, 
and people think you're silly because of that.; 
And you are silly, because...;
The bigger the hammer...;
                  THE STRONGER IT IS!!;
357-FAKE CREDITS;
-----358-EVERYTHING EXPLODES--;
The hammers, they've stopped working!;
The TVs have stopped working! What's going on?;
361-TEACHER TELEPORTS;
Quickly, Piko! There's no time to explain! ;
My house shouldn't be here, i didn't 
even do anything!;
I don't understand, wasn't the Neon 
energy supposed to stop the teleportation?;
It was, but... It can't be...;
Did Neon really just energy stop working...?;
Piko! We must find the thieves who stole the 
Holy Hammer! ;
They could be able to control Neon energy now! 
Without the energy, we have no hammers. 
And without hammers...; 
We have no hope...;
My hammer still works fine!;
...That's right! Your toy hammer doesn't use 
any type of energy!;
Piko, you are the ONLY ONE who can save us!!;
WHAAAAAAAT?!;
WHAAAAAAAT?!;
Am I... Am I the hero now?;
Not the hero we want, but the hero we need!;
There's no time, I'll trace the energy! 
We'll find out where those thieves are hiding!;
Follow me!;
379- INSIDE TEACHER ROOM;
I've updated the CookieMap;
But this place... It gives me the heebie-jeebies! ;
Well, good luck!;
383-CYBER ROBOT GIRL;
HI!!;
Well this is new.
How were you able to bypass my firewall?;
That was easy, I just had to bash the doors a bunch!
The code is DRW-R--R--1!;
At last, someone figured it out!;
Huh?;
So far, you're the only human to come here! 
The only one worthy of seeing...;
MY MAGICAL GIRL TRANSFORMATION!!;
What's going on? She's... transforming?!;
392- ROBOT GIRL ROTATES AND FAILS;
Meant to do that. 100%. Big success;
Whoa, you almost killed me!;
Don't worry, we're currently in cyberspace. You can't be killed by anything in here;
Here, take this little light projector as a prize. I've signed it and everything!;
Hope you enjoyed the show! See you soon!;
398-GRAVE BOSS FIGHT;
Give us back the Holy Hammer, monster!
  You don't belong in this world!; 
 It is not by my hand that I am roused from slumber. 
  I was enjoying a peaceful rest, but my quiet 
    grave was disturbed by...      humans   
      with strange televisions for heads!; 
 What are you talking about?! 
  YOU stole the Hammer and then 
    everything stopped working! ; 
How could you!;
I had no choice!;
You always have a choice. 
You just keep making the wrong one.; 
And who are you to lecture me?!
I will choose what 
I damn well please, and 
NOTHING CAN STOP ME NOW! MUAHAHA!; 
Alright, enough of this. 
It's time to beat you with my Hammer!; 
What is a hammer?         
A miserable little tool 
for the working class... 
But enough talk, have at--; 
HAMMER TIME!;
409-TRIO BOSS;
Hm... Ancient glyphs...?;
Looks like a dead end, girls. Can anyone here read these ancient scripts?;
Hii, girl with the glowing hammer!;
What the... How did you get here?;
I could you ask you the same thing, you know! How did you pass through the energy door-field thingy?;
Well, if you must know, I used my powers of deduction and reasoning to find a secret passage;
She's the best, isn't she?;
It's all just simple problem solving and pattern recognition!;
That's lame. I got here by beating up a bunch of ghosts and skeletons! Waay cooler.;
Those things don't even exist!;
I agree, 100% improbable!;
G... ghosts?;
Aw Beth, it's okay! Don't let this dummy fool you, there's no such thing as ghosts!;
 Hey, Beth? Those glyphs you were talking about? 
They appear to say something along the lines of 
  Only a single master blacksmith may enter this room...  ; 
Really? How convenient! I was just looking for an excuse to have a rematch with dummy Piko here!;
Hey, stop calling me that!;
C'mon, dummy! Let's end this, one last fight before the final door!;
427- FINAL DOOR OPENS;
You! How did you...?!;
It's the power of FRIENDSHIP, dummy!;
Ugh, that's not how it was supposed to go! My family has had the title of Master Blacksmith for generations, I can't be the one to fail!;
Pfft, who cares about family titles? You should do what you like, not what your family demands of you...;
Just believe in your heart!;
Believe in...  my heart...;
434-TEACHER END;
Nani?!;
 Ohh, it's Piko! I really didn't think you were gonna make it this far!;
 
Well, at least you proved an adequate distraction...;
You're just in time to see my FINAL CREATION!!;
The end of the Red Era of the Hammer is at hand!;
So you were the Master Blacksmith all this time!;
Incorrect!;
What?;
I'm simply here to make society surpass its natural limits! My Neon Fusion is the key to that!;
But what about Neon energy? All electronics have stopped working...;
Everything was fake... Even my glasses...;
ARE FAKE!!;
447-THE TEACHER TROWS THE GLASSES AT THE COMPUTER AND THE FIGHT BEGINS;
Could it be...? Am I being defeated?;
It's over, sensei!;
NO! That's not how it works!;
No more lies, sensei!;
I'm finishing this and going home. 
I'm tired, I'm cold and I want to go to sleep!;

I'm gonna flip the switch and turn everything down!;
THE END?;

454- TRUE END part 1;
Oh, little girl, you appear to be lost!;
Hey there, old lady!;
Quit calling me old! How did you even come to be 
in a place like this?;
This is my Fun Place! 
I get to have all the candy in the city! 
No, all the candy in the UNIVERSE!!;
That's no good, sugar is bad for you! 
You'll get a toothache!;
I can do anything! 
Anything at all, I need but to imagine it! 
Even watermelon trees!;
What is up with this place? 
The CookieMap is going nuts!;
...Are you doing this?;
 That's easy, all I had to do was make everyone 
believe that a   Master Blacksmith   existed, 
then I manipulate all of their hammers and 
STEAL ALL THE EXISTENT ENERGY!!; 
But yours... Your hammer is different. 
Something failed when I tried to control it...;
That's because I made it by myself with 
LOVE and CARE!;
It's a toy then! I see, you mean to use it for play!;
Join me! Let's just play, forever!;

469-TRUE END part 2;
So you were the one who stole the 
Holy Hammer all along!;
Holy what now? What are you talking about?;
Bah, it doesn't matter! 
I'm gonna turn this all off and end this for good!;
SORRY PIKO, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT;
474- THE GIANT ROBOT APPEARS AND GRABS THE BALLONG GIRL;
HEY, THAT WASN'T 
THE DEAL! 
YOU CHEATED!;
I MERELY DID AS WAS STIPULATED
THAT YOU WERE MANIPULATED IS 
MISFORTUNE OF YOUR OWN MAKING; 
BUT YOUR GENIUS MIND IS MOST USEFUL
I SHALL HAVE YET MORE WORK FOR YOU, AND SOON; 
WITH THE ENERGY OF THE HOLY HAMMER, I AM...;

480-TRUE END FINAL PART;
THIS CANNOT BE! HOW IS IT THAT THIS PLASTIC TOY 
IS ABLE TO DEFEAT US?!;
Ugh, I'm tired of you people calling it a plastic toy! 
Can you not see the glowing heart in the middle?
